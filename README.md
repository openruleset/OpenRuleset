## What is the Open Ruleset project?
The Open Ruleset project aims to provide free and ready-to-use rulesets for a variety of esports. We know that for both new and seasoned tournament organizers alike writing and maintaining rulesets can be a tedious and frustrating task. By providing these rulesets open-source we want to eliminate that hassle while still allowing leagues/tournaments the flexibility to make necessary changes as they see fit, so that organizers can focus more on the player experience.

## How can I contribute to the Open Ruleset project?
The Open Ruleset project welcomes new contributors, however we ask that you please follow the following contribution guidelines:
* At all times, follow our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
* Writing error corrections and rule suggestions should be made using the [issue tracker](https://github.com/openruleset/OpenRuleset/issues) unless the content of the issue spans multiple sections of a ruleset. In this case, we ask that you create a project fork, make your suggested edits, then submit a [pull request](https://github.com/openruleset/OpenRuleset/pulls).
* New game rulesets should be submitted on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/openruleset/OpenRuleset/issues) before a pull request will be accepted. Please do not submit your new game ruleset suggestions inside of your pull request.
* Ruleset translations should be submitted in a new file that shares the same name as the original plus the [language code](http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm). For example, the `csgo.md` ruleset translated to Japanese should be located in a new file named `csgo_ja-JP.md`. Ruleset translations must undergo an approval process before they will be committed to the repository.
